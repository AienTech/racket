# Racket!

Racket is a yeoman generator for creating universal/isomorphic web applications. One of the pains for developers who want to use React or want to develop universal apps was knowing which libraries to choose and how tie them up.

Racket responds to this issue by giving you the option to choose the tools/technologies that you prefer the most and offering a good structure that you can maintain for years!

## Get started

Install `yo` and `generator-racket`:

```
npm i -g yo generator racket
```

Make a directory and cd into it:

```
mkdir awesome-racket
cd awesome-racket
```

Run `yo racket` to start creating your awesome app:

```
yo racket
```

## Technologies
From each item with multiple options, you can choose the one you prefer:

- **UI Library**: react, preact
- **Side effects**: redux-thunk, redux-saga
- **Styling**: sass, less, PostCSS (soon), Radium (soon)
- Redux
- Webpack
- Enzyme
